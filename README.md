# A Resume app built with Flutter

# HNGi9 Task 2

# Description
This Resume mobile application is a compilation of my professional summary, skills, projects and social media accounts. This app can switch between light and dark mode. It is responsive and it has my social media links.

## Description of the Code
The assets folders houses all images I used in the creation of this app. I used Provider for the state management.
The view folder has all application screens and the widgets folder contains the custom widgets.

## Library I used
 * Provider: Used for state management and because this what I know
 * url_launcher: Used for launching social media on external browser.
 * MediaQuery: used for responsiveness.

## Description of the Design
I got inspiration from the [example](https://dribbble.com/shots/14436103-Resume-App) that was posted with the question.
